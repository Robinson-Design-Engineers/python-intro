    "Let's define a very simple function for calculating the volume flow rate of water in a river. The volume flow rate tells you the volume of water flowing past a particular point in the river every second; e.g., 500 cubic feet per second. We typically refer to this important quantity with the variable, $Q$. One way in which we can define $Q$ is as the product of the average velocity of water in the river (how fast it's moving) multiplied by the cross sectional flow area (the area of water made by a 2D plane that intersection the bottom of the river at a perpendicular angle through which the water is flowing):\n",

    "Now let's define a function that will give us $Q$ if we give it $A$ and $V$. After the first line of defining a function and its arguments, an indent is used to keep everything in line within the function. In the last line where it says \"return\", include a space following \"return\" and then the operation. Then run the function with its arguments in the same line as the print() statement. You can define the variables in line with the print statement or in the lines before calling the function."
