To use this tutorial without installing any Python library or IDE on your desktop, open the .ipynb (Jupyter notebook) file in Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/). To open in Colab, follow the link, click File > Upload notebook > Browse. Otherwise you can open in your local IDE (VS Code, JupyterLabs, etc.). Be sure to make a copy of the .ipynb before opening to ensure no two people are working on the same file and to avoid corruption through Dropbox errors.
